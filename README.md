# Gamer-Cat
Cat that clicks mouse and keyboard everytime when you do!

by Yurtrimu#1100

You can draw your own cat and customize it!

You can set TopMost to false or other options in settings.txt

//Not recommended to change the variable format of the settings.txt

//The program.exe may give wrong alert because it uses GetAsyncKeyState() that keyloggers use to record mouse and keyboard.
